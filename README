This project repackages the [OpenBSD](http://www.openbsd.org/) fork of
[OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/), [LibreSSL](http://www.libressl.org/), so
it is buildable on other systems.

To build, you need autoconf, automake and libtool installed.

Run autogen.sh followed by ./configure.

This is an alpha work-in-progress, not ready for general use.

It has been tested to work on:
 Ubuntu 14.04 amd64
 FreeBSD 10 amd64
 Mac OS X 10.9.2

TODO:
  CPU detection
  configurable algorithm support
  acceleration
