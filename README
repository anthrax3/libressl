This project repackages the OpenBSD (http://www.openbsd.org/) fork of
OpenSSL (https://www.openssl.org/), LibreSSL (http://www.libressl.org/), so
it is buildable on other systems.

To build, you need autoconf, automake and libtool installed.

Run autogen.sh followed by ./configure; make; make check

Note that multi-threaded builds work as expected. You may need to periodically
clean up your source tree or rerun autogen.sh/update.sh to get the latest
source.

Warning:
This is an alpha work-in-progress, not ready for general use.

Caveat Emptor:
While this project uses compatibility shims and imports functions from
OpenBSD's libc and OpenSSH, it will probably never work exactly the same as if
it is running on OpenBSD.  Until there is an official port of LibreSSL (and
even after), please conduct your own audits and patches are always welcome.

Luckily there is not much actual code in this port, so it is easy to review.
