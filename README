This project repackages the OpenBSD (http://www.openbsd.org/) fork of
OpenSSL (https://www.openssl.org/), LibreSSL (http://www.libressl.org/), so
it is buildable on other systems.

To build, you need autoconf, automake and libtool installed.
To run all unit tests, you need python installed as well.

Run 'autogen.sh' followed by './configure; make; make check'

To build a tarball, run 'make dist'

You may need to periodically clean up your source tree or rerun
autogen.sh/update.sh in order to import the latest source from the git
submodules.

Warning:
This is an alpha work-in-progress, not ready for general use. It is based on
semi-regular snapshots of the upstream code with minimal patching.

Use it to check application compatibility, security research, code auditing, or
to just see what the LibreSSL team is up to. Please do not bug the OpenBSD team
about platform issues you may find with this code unless the fix is generally
applicable to OpenBSD as well.

Please also read Nick Mathewson's warning on libottery:
    https://github.com/nmathewson/libottery

Caveat Emptor:
While this project uses compatibility shims and imports functions from
OpenBSD's libc and OpenSSH, it will probably never work exactly the same as if
it is running on OpenBSD.  Until there is an official port of LibreSSL (and
even after), please conduct your own audits and patches are always welcome.

See crypto/compat for the bulk of the compatibility code. There are also
a few patches on top of the upstream OpenBSD source, though this project aims
to keep those at an absolute minimum.

It has been tested to build on these platforms:
 Ubuntu 14.04 amd64 / armhf
 Centos 6.5 i686
 FreeBSD 10 amd64
 Mac OS X 10.9.3
