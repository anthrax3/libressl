This project repackages the [OpenBSD](http://www.openbsd.org/) fork of
[OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/), [LibreSSL](http://www.libressl.org/), so
it is buildable on other systems.

To build, you need autoconf, automake and libtool installed.

Run autogen.sh followed by ./configure.

This is an alpha work-in-progress, not ready for general use.

It has been tested to work on Ubuntu 14.04 and Mac OS X 10.9 with static
applications.
